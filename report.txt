Report on Challenges faced

- The challenge was more on passing the values, i.e i did not want the user to directly access the 2nd page directly unless he gives his first and last name. So i created slug for each user that is unique.
- The slug is used in url to access the 2nd page game-page, thus limiting the direct access to some extend. 
- I needed to add some css to form fields, as the form fields where in forms.py, so had to do bit of search to add those class and styles in forms.py. I added in __init__ function of form class
